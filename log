    Set up dialog class plotDialog to allow easy change of axes limits in FFTPanel. Added grid to all plots. Added warning messages that describes the row append bug in the table. Added additional radio buttons to select In Phase Y or Out Phase Y for analysis

    Added toolbar and allowed plots to stretch if the size of the frames are increase (i.e. added a sizer to each canvas and allowed it to change in proportion)

    Checked results against Aaron's program using real data. Works! Changed the inv_field method to use Stephen's four point method. The reason why it didn't work before was because the arguments to inv_field was reversed, should be (data, field)

    Set up the grid to display all the clicked values. Set up save function. Still a bit off if I clear a value in the grid and then click again. Needs work

    extra plot window now combined to the single FFTPanel.py file, and added navigation tools so we can now pan and save. Also added mouse event but that is currently interfering with the pan in navigation, it also picks up mouse coordiantes regardless if it is on the line

    Plots FFT and smoothes. However the smoothed function has 1/B as x-axis and despiked has B as axis, so cannot plot the two on the same plot (currently the case). Needs to figure out a way to have a dialog that plots FFT and shows the peaks, and write them to file

    Wrote a new inv_field function in dHvA_Util that will interpolate and extrapolate for new 1/B values to match the FFT

    Updated the file open dialog so that if I have selected the data before (i.e. the combo boxes are not empty), then I will upate the xdata and ydata arrays so I don't have select the same data array again (i.e. reselect anything from one of the combo boxes). The wavelet filter seem to add 1 more element when reconstructing, and seem to only happen to certain data sets. Not sure why

    Plots despiked data. However, it appears that wavelet filter returns an array with length longer than the original x array for actual data. Aaron did not plot this, it needs to be addressed

    plot polynomial BG fit and subtracts. The data range error box still need work (i.e. if the data starts at 4T, selecting 0-4T does not return error). Set up the data selection so that if no file is opened, a file open dialog will appear.

    Tested cases where the polynomial will change up on pressing apply button. Also removes the preivous plot when repainting

    The control for min/max implemented, but it seems that the plot is not overwriting itself but just adding more x and y data (i.e. the colour changes)
